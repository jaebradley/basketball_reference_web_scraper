<<'###POETRY_INSTALLATION_DOCUMENTATION'
  From https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-manually;

  "Poetry can be installed manually using pip and the venv module. By doing so you will essentially perform the steps carried out by the official installer. As this is an advanced installation method, these instructions are Unix-only and omit specific examples such as installing from git.

  The variable $VENV_PATH will be used to indicate the path at which the virtual environment was created.

  python3 -m venv $VENV_PATH
  $VENV_PATH/bin/pip install -U pip setuptools
  $VENV_PATH/bin/pip install poetry

  Poetry will be available at $VENV_PATH/bin/poetry and can be invoked directly or symlinked elsewhere.

  To uninstall Poetry, simply delete the entire $VENV_PATH directory."
