# Home

This project is in no way affiliated with [`basketball-reference.com`](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) (and I 
hope the fine folks at **Basketball Reference** do not get too upset at me for creating and maintaining this project).

Please use this project responsibly as **Basketball Reference** is a very useful resource.

## Background

This library was created for another Python project where I was trying to estimate an NBA player's productivity 
(for, uh, ~~daily fantasy sports~~ "science").

A lot of sports-related APIs are expensive - luckily, **Basketball Reference** provides a free service which can be scraped 
and translated into a usable API.

## Installation

[This project is published to `PyPi`](https://pypi.org/project/basketball-reference-web-scraper/).

It can be installed via `pip`.

```bash
pip install basketball_reference_web_scraper
```

!!! note
    This library requires `Python 3.4+` 

!!! note
    Currently, only data from seasons after the `1999-2000` season is supported

!!! note
    There are currently two supported major versions - `3+` and `4+`.
